# Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone - Bike Share Analysis

## Portfolio Project Introduction

This project demonstrates my data analysis skills and ability to apply them to a real-world business scenario. As a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I was tasked with analyzing the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. Using R (programming language), I processed historical trip data to derive actionable insights for converting casual riders into annual members. This project is to demonstrate my ability to clean and analyze large datasets, uncover meaningful insights, and translate findings into strategic business recommendations.

## My Thought Process

My process involved collecting 12 months of past trip data, then using R and the tidyverse package to clean the data, handle missing values, and create new variables for analysis. Through exploratory data analysis, I generated summary statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns.

Key discoveries included significant differences in usage patterns: members (64% of trips) primarily use bikes for short weekday commutes averaging 12.8 minutes, peaking during typical commute hours. Casual riders (36% of trips) prefer longer rides averaging 24.58 minutes, with usage spread throughout the day and peaking on weekends. I found that casual riders frequent tourist attractions, while members use bikes in residential and commercial areas. These distinct patterns suggest members use the service for practical purposes like commuting, while casual riders tend towards leisure and recreational use. 

Based on these insights, I developed targeted recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members, focusing on incentivizing recreational use, awareness campaigns for commuters, and introducing varied membership discounts.
